          Hello! My name is Audi, and I am currently a Senior in Computer Science
          at Wayne State University. My passion for math and computers has naturally
          led me to where I am today. Over the past three years, I've dedicated
          myself to learning the principles of Software Engineering. Take a look at what
          I have experience with!

      Like most people, I have many interests I like to satisfy outside of school and work.
      Here are some of the things I put most of my time into. </p>

      <h3>Hackathons</h3>

      <div class="row-left">
        <div class="text">
          <p>I have attended SpartaHack all three years spent at Wayne, and each
            one was an entirely new experience. I had the opportunity to lead a
            team of four for the past two years. We even made it to the frontline
            s of <a href="https://bit.ly/4gFoGZa">MSU News</a> AND their yearbook!.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>Although this was a hobby of mine, I can confidently say I have gained
            valuable knowledge in both leadership and communication. </p>

      <h3>Languages</h3>
      <div class="row-right">
        <p>
          Something I have always been interested in as the ultimate form of
          communication: languages. I believe language learning is the first step
          in understanding someoneâ€™s culture and motives. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="row-left">
        <img src="photos/goblin.jpg" alt="Language Hack Project">
        <p>
          Part of my learning approach has been based around the Language Acquisition
          philosophy. This makes any type of content consumption helpful, if done in
          a meaningful way. This was even the proposal of our hack at the most recent
          SpartaHack! <a href="courses.html">Click here</a> to see our project design for it. .

      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <div class="row-left">
        <img src="photos/bumblebee.jpg" alt="Travel Adventures">
        <p>
          I have always been open to new cultures, but only recently have I have the
          opportunity to start traveling. These are from more recent trips I have
          taken with friends. We have been visiting different landmarks around Michigan
          for the past few years.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row-right">
        <p>
          These trips have allowed me to meet so many new people and gain some perspective
          in life. It is very interesting to see new sights one day and come home with
          fresh eyes the next. </p>
