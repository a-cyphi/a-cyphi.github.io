[about]

hello! my name is audi, and I am currently a senior in computer science at wayne state university. 
growing up, i always knew i liked math and computers, so when it came time to decide what path i 
would take, the choice was obvious. i have dedicated the past three years to learning the principles
in software engineering, and in that time i have gained expeirence with: 
  (tabs/sections) languages       web dev      project tools 
  python, c/pp/#, java, js        so on so on
c python java js sql              html css react node.js        git/github azuredevops (nxCAD)

[get to know me!]

like most people, i have many interests i like to satisfy outside of school and work. here are 
some of the things i put most of my time into: 

interests 
hackathons: i attended spartahack three years in a row, and even ended up on the msu news site AND in their
yearbook (picture with "thats me!" other pic with "me again!"). 
languages: talk about being involved in other cultures and proposal for capstone
friends/family: talk about going out with ff and places we've been. diverse friend group, making me open minded.
traveling a lot, again, openminded

these skills are curretly being put to work with this semesters classes. as it is my final semester,
i am taking my senior capstone along with web tech and mobile app dev to bring a rounded end to my 
time here. 

here are some of the highlights of my academic career: the courses i learned the most from in terms 
of practicality and usability. feel free to reference [the course catalogue] for more information about 
each class. 
current courses: 
capstone
web tech
mobile app 
capstone: the culmination of my academic career, capstone is a class that challenges me every step of
the way. here, we focus on the foundations of being a software engineer. this includes documentation, 
design, organization, structure, and perspective. working in a group of four, we meet constantly to 
review what work is in progress, blockers, and how to address issues moving forward. *

web tech: this is a second step course, following web dev which covered the very basics of website design.
here, i will be producing a handful of personal project while also contributing to a group term project*
by the end of this semester, i will have the skills to create static and dynamic content, implement 
security techniques, and hadnle electronic commerce on the web. but thats not all! 

mobile app dev: a class that i have been wanting to take since it was annoucned. i would like to find
my way into mobile dev, and with this course, i can learn all of the primary elemnts of Anroid application
development along with its best practices. i will be completing projects highlighting the different features
that can be made possible using android studio and java. 

past courses:
