        Here are some of the highlights of my time at Wayne, courses that
        taught me the most in terms of practicality and usability. Feel free
        to reference the course catalog for more information about each class.

      <img src="photos/lines.png" alt="line detail">
      <p>
        The culmination of my academic career, Capstone is a class that challenges
        me at every turn. Here, we focus on the foundations of being a Software Engineer.
        This includes documentation, design, organization, structure, and perspective.
        Working with my team of four, we meet constantly to review what work is in progress,
        what blockers we may be facing, and how to address issues moving forward.
      </p>

    <h2>Principles of Web Technology</h2>
    <div id="course-sections">
      <img src="photos/lines.png" alt="line detail">
      <p>
        This is a second step course, following its introduction class covering the basics
        of web design. Here, I will be producing a handful of personal projects while also
        contributing to a group term project. By the end of this semester, I will have the
        skills to create static and dynamic content, implement security techniques, and
        handle electronic commerce on the web.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Mobile App Development</h2>
    <div id="course-sections">
      <img src="photos/lines.png" alt="line detail">
      <p>
        A class that also yields many projects and experience in terms of deployment. This
        course covers all of the primary elements of Android application development along
        with its best practices. These projects I will be completing highlight the different
        features that can be made possible using Android Studio and Java.

    <h2>Hacks - Tabbi!</h2>
    <div class="row-left">
      <div class="text">
        <p>Tabbi! is a gamefied productivity app that encourages users to work
          under the incentive of providing a nice, lavish life for their newfound
          Tabby cat. Ideally, users would be able to gain money by setting timers,
          increasing productivity in real life, and use their funds to purchase
          upgrades for their cat. </p>

        <p>The final product would also allow for users to add friends, letting
          them foster a bigger work environment so they can end their shifts with
          more coins! They would even get a tutorial from a street cat that
          never got a home: Rocco. While this project has been put on the back
          burner, this is definitely something I aim to fully flesh out after graduation. </p>

    <h2>Hacks - Flu-Int</h2>
    <div class="row-right">
      <div class="image">

      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Flu-Int is an all-in-one study tool for language learners using the Language
          Acquisition method. This follows the philosophy that adults can learn languages
          more effectively by taking the same approach that babies do, but making it
          more efficient! While babies have no concept of what study and repetition is,
          adults do. </p>

      <div class="text">
        <p>The main goal with this app is to incorporate the most important aspects of
          language learning in one place. Our key points were immersion, repetition, and
          feedback. We aim to not only provide a place with effective study tools, but
          also bring together learners and natives alike. </p>
